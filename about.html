<p>My name is Malik Mukdadi, I'm currently a sophomore dual majoring in Computer
    and Electrical Engineering. I really love learning about computers in general, and I try to be involved
    as much as I can everyday! I'm the president of the IEEE chapter at WVU and had recently completed an internship
    at 4D Tech Solutions in Fairmont (it was so amazing)! My hobbies outside of academics include lifting, playing
    video games (im a bit addicted to Valorant right now), and play the guitar! </p>
